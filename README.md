## 🌟 Why This Repository Matters

QuikSteel specializes in high-performance repair compounds—like **epoxy putties, metal repair pastes, and plastic repair sticks**—used in construction, industrial maintenance, and DIY projects. These products are powerful, but they can pose serious risks if mishandled:

- ⚠️ **Toxic exposure or poisoning** (via skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion)
- 🔥 **Flammability and chemical hazards** if stored or handled incorrectly
- 🧪 **Reactivity risks** when mixed with other chemicals
- 🌱 **Environmental hazards** from spills or improper disposal

By sharing SDS/MSDS documents openly, we help everyone **learn how to handle these materials safely**, **develop AI tools that can interpret safety data**, and provide **life-saving guidance during emergencies**.

---

## 📑 What’s Inside

Each SDS/MSDS follows the **standard 16-section safety format** to ensure clarity and usability:

1. Identification 🏭
2. Hazard Identification ⚠️
3. Composition / Ingredients 🧪
4. First-Aid Measures 🚑
5. Fire-Fighting Measures 🔥
6. Accidental Release Measures 🧹
7. Handling & Storage 📦
8. Exposure Controls / Personal Protection 🥽
9. Physical & Chemical Properties ⚗️
10. Stability & Reactivity 🔄
11. Toxicological Information ☠️
12. Ecological Information 🌱
13. Disposal Considerations ♻️
14. Transport Information 🚛
15. Regulatory Information 📜
16. Other Information ℹ️

This structured approach ensures **students can learn**, **AI systems can process**, and **professionals can respond quickly** in real-world emergencies.
